# # Intoduction
# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# # Data Science Languages
# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
# 1. **Python:** Widely used for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing
# 2. **R:** Specifically designed for statistics and data analysis
# 3. **SQL:** Essential for database querying and manipulation

# # Data science libraries
# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 1. **Pandas:** A powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python.
# 2. **NumPy:** Essential for numerical computing and working with large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
# 3. **Scikit-learn:** A machine learning library for classical machine learning algorithms and tools.

# ### Examples of Evaluating Arithmetic Expressions in Python
# 
# Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python:
# 
# 1. Addition:
#    ```python
#    result = 5 + 3
#    print(result)  # Output: 8
# 

# In[17]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add integers.
result = (3 * 4) + 5
print(result)


# In[18]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.
minutes = 200
hours = minutes / 60
print(hours)
